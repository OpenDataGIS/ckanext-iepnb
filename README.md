| 2.9             | yes    |

Suggested values:

* "yes"

## Installation

To install ckanext-iepnb:

1. Activate your CKAN virtual environment, for example:

     `. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate`

2. Clone the source and install it on the virtualenv

    `git clone https://github.com/OpenDataGIS/ckanext-iepnb.git`
    
    `cd ckanext-iepnb`
    
    `pip install -e .`
    
	`pip install -r requirements.txt` (actually not mandatory, but is a good habit) 

3. Add `iepnb` to the `ckan.plugins` setting in your CKAN
   config file (by default the config file is located at
   `/etc/ckan/default/ckan.ini`).
   
4. Add iepnb specific configuration to the CKAN config file

5. Restart CKAN. For example if you've deployed CKAN with Apache on Ubuntu:

     `sudo service apache2 reload`


## Config settings

At CKAN config .ini file (in `/etc/ckan/default` dir), into the [app:main] section, add:

	#Server to download menu and breadcrumbs. Demo assets server: https://github.com/OpenDataGIS/ckanext-iepnb_assets
	iepnb.server = https://some_server

	#default breadcrumbs
	iepnb.breadcrumbs = [{"title":"Some literal","description":"Some description", "relative":"relative_path_from_iepnb.server"},...]

	#relative path to download menu in iepnb.server. Demo path_menu in ckanext-iepnb_assets: /main.json
	iepnb.path_menu = /api/menu_items/main         

	#number of popular tags to show at index page
	iepnb.popular_tags = 3

	#relative path to download breadcrumbs definition. Will take precedence over iepnb.headcrumbs if defined
	iepnb.path_breadcrumbs = No_Default_Value

## Releasing a new version of ckanext-iepnb

If ckanext-iepnb should be available on PyPI you can follow these steps to publish a new version:

1. Update the version number in the `setup.py` file. See [PEP 440](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#public-version-identifiers) for how to choose version numbers.

2. Make sure you have the latest version of necessary packages:

    pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel twine

3. Create a source and binary distributions of the new version:

       python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel && twine check dist/*

   Fix any errors you get.

4. Upload the source distribution to PyPI:

       twine upload dist/*

5. Commit any outstanding changes:

       git commit -a
       git push

6. Tag the new release of the project on GitHub with the version number from
   the `setup.py` file. For example if the version number in `setup.py` is
   0.0.1 then do:

       git tag 0.0.1
